# Material Switcher depending on time of day

Do you need to be able to switch materials on your prefabs depending on what time of day it is in your scene?
This script enables you to switch from say daytime material to night time.
This is great for using on a buildings window to add light and emissions at night and during the day time back to normal.

 Just add this script to the object and set the two materials and set the Daytime start time and the Nightime start time by default  the Day start is 6 A.M. and the Night start is 6 P.M.  This utilized the built in DayNightTimeUpdater.
